# The Ruby Bibliography

A list of Ruby research theses and papers.

Contributions welcome, but we'd like to focus on high quality theses and papers
from well regarded conferences and journals. We aren't looking to list technical
books for Ruby users, for example.

Theses and papers should normally have been reputably peer reviewed or viva'd to
be included.
